# Portfolio

Portfolio made for academic purposes in which the projects described in it are non-existent (I intend to use it in the future for my own projects). 

In the code, I managed to organize the folders well for each part of the CSS. I used a little JS for effects on the page and responsiveness adjustment and of course, HTML for the main code.
